                    <strong><small></strong><p>Hello, and welcome to my blog page. My name is Samuel Malwal, and I am a new software engineering student. The journey to becoming a software engineer has been quite the journey. To start, I am originally from Sudan and migrated with my family to the U.S. in my teen years due to a civil war that was occurring at the time. I attend high school and college here in the U.S. I obtained my undergraduate degree in political science and minored in business management.</p>

                    <strong><small></small></strong> So how did I get here? How did I get from politics and business into software? Well, the answer is more complex. I have traveled on many roads to get here. To start, I must return to the earlier years of college, where I took a computer science class as an elective; during this class, I was introduced to some coding, and I was curious how one code returns something different for a user, while I learned a few things about CSS and Html, my interest was still in policies, international development and things of that nature, I could not see beyond those things at the time, remember if you know anything about international politics, then you would know that I come from a country torn apart by a war that later split it into two nation-states.

                    <p>Growing up, I did not know anyone doing anything with computers; I had only heard of the likes of Bill Gates, but I told myself that those types of people grew up around computers; At the same time, you just touched your first computer at 14, there is no way you can code or do anything with computers. I talked myself out of my curiosity about computers. As time went post-college, I took on odd jobs in an attempt to fund my master’s degree, something that I feel was a must for a liberal art major.</p>

                    <strong><small></small></strong> <p></p>my effort to raise funds for a post-graduate program, I got into the oilfield (oil & gas industry), where I got a role as a sales and service technician; here, my curiosity peaked again. As part of my job, I took apart machines used for drilling operations and reprogrammed them. It was not easy initially, but I had to learn about the software and the hardware and how they drive each other to meet the function. Here again, I wanted to learn how the programmed code in the system was written to drive the hardware. The job was about one application and specific hardware. Still, I wanted to know how to create an application that works with other systems, and that is when I started to research and look for ways to develop software, and finally, I think I found a way. I am hoping I can learn to code and learn to develop applications.</p>

                    <strong><small></small></strong><p></p> my interests and hobbies, I do not have many; the few that I have include traveling, hiking, running, and soccer. I grew up playing soccer, which is a big part of my life. In fact, it is one of the things that helped me get into college. Hiking and running are things I pick up along the way; growing up in New England and living in Colorado, I think those two activities naturally become part of everyone’s things to do.</p>

                    <strong><small></small></strong><p></p> writing this blog, I hope I have given you enough information about my background. I hope that what you read will keep you interested in continuing to follow me during this journey of becoming a software engineer. I am still determining how it will all work out, but I am very excited to finally learn about software, and hopefully, someday, I will be able to do something with it.</p>
